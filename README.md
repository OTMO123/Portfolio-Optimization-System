Portfolio Optimization System
Overview
This comprehensive portfolio optimization system provides tools for sophisticated investment portfolio analysis, optimization, and management. It combines modern portfolio theory with AI-enhanced market analysis to deliver data-driven investment allocation recommendations.
Installation
bashpip install -r requirements.txt
API Keys Required
This system requires the following API keys:

Alpha Vantage API (for stock data)
FRED API (for macroeconomic data)
News API (for news retrieval)
Anthropic API (for sentiment analysis)

Store your API keys in the appropriate configuration files or use the interactive key setup when first running the system.
Modules
RiskReturnOptimizer
The core module that integrates multiple data sources to optimize investment portfolios:

Retrieves stock price data from Yahoo Finance and Alpha Vantage
Incorporates macroeconomic indicators from FRED
Performs clustering and portfolio optimization
Calculates optimal asset weights based on risk and return profiles

pythonfrom RiskReturnOptimizer import main as optimizer
optimizer.main()
Portfolio Optimization Module
Implements various portfolio optimization strategies:

Sharpe ratio maximization
Volatility minimization
Risk parity and maximum diversification approaches
Black-Litterman model and robust optimization
Target return and target risk optimization

Visualization Module
Creates comprehensive portfolio visualizations:

Efficient frontier plots with optimal portfolios
Correlation matrices and risk contribution analysis
Performance metrics including returns, drawdowns, and volatility
Interactive dashboards for portfolio analysis

Data Handling Module
Manages financial data acquisition and processing:

Multi-source stock data retrieval
Macroeconomic indicator integration
Market indices and sector performance tracking
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Date Management Module
Facilitates time period selection for investment analysis:

Period-based analysis (quarterly, monthly, annually)

Investment Allocation Module
Translates portfolio weights into actionable investment plans:

Calculates investment amounts based on portfolio weights
Determines rebalancing requirements
Creates dollar-cost averaging schedules
Simulates portfolio drift over time

Risk-Return Analysis Module

Risk measures (VaR, CVaR, maximum drawdown)
Performance indicators (Sharpe, Sortino, Treynor ratios)
Portfolio stress testing capabilities
Monte Carlo simulations

News Sentiment Analysis Module
Enhances portfolio decisions with market sentiment analysis:

Retrieves company, sector, and market news
Utilizes Anthropic API for news sentiment analysis
Aggregates sentiment results to generate market forecasts
Evaluates potential news impact on market prices

Usage Example
python# Import necessary modules
from module_data import load_stock_data
from module_optimization import optimize_sharpe_ratio
from module_visualization import plot_efficient_frontier
from module_investment_allocation import print_investment_allocation

# Define tickers and time period
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'TSLA']
start_date = '2020-01-01'
end_date = '2023-01-01'

# Load data
data = load_stock_data(tickers, start_date, end_date)

# Calculate returns and covariance
returns = data.pct_change().dropna()
mean_returns = returns.mean() * 252
cov_matrix = returns.cov() * 252

# Optimize portfolio
optimal_weights, metrics = optimize_sharpe_ratio(mean_returns, cov_matrix)

# Print results
print(f"Expected Return: {metrics['return']:.2%}")
print(f"Expected Risk: {metrics['volatility']:.2%}")
print(f"Sharpe Ratio: {metrics['sharpe']:.2f}")

# Visualize portfolio
plot_efficient_frontier(mean_returns, cov_matrix, optimized_weights=optimal_weights)

# Generate investment allocation
investment_amount = 10000
print_investment_allocation(optimal_weights, investment_amount, tickers)
